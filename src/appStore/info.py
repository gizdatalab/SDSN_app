    National Development Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions) \
    continuously increases, a major challenge for policy action tracking â€“ the \
    evaluation of stated goals and targets and their actual implementation on \

    For this purpose, the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions \
    Network (SDSN) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale \
    Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH are collaborated in the development \
    of this AI-powered open-source web application that helps find and extract \
    relevant information from public policy documents faster to facilitate \
    evidence-based decision-making processes in sustainable development and beyond.  
    This tool allows policy analysts and other users the possibility to rapidly \
    search for relevant information/paragraphs in the document according to the \
    userâ€™s interest, classify the documentâ€™s content according to the Sustainable \
    Development Goals (SDGs), and compare climate-related policy documents and NDCs \
    across countries using open data from the German Institute of Development and \
    Sustainabilityâ€™s (IDOS) NDC Explorer.

    the project, see the attached concept note. We hope you like our application ðŸ˜Š
